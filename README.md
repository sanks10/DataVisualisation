# DataVisualisation
Data Visualisation using TypeScript and React components, built using CRA.

Using Terminal/Command Prompt, go to the directory where the files are installed, and run following commands:-
1.) yarn init -y
2.) yarn add recharts
3,) yarn add axios

Once everything has installed, and you're in the root directory,
run, the following command on command prompt:-

yarn start

This should compile the application, and your web application
will open a tab with the link "http://localhost:3000", this is 
what the end result would look like.
